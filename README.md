Breast Cancer Detection

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on clinical features. The implementation leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to achieve high accuracy in cancer detection.

📂 Dataset

The project utilizes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (or another dataset, if applicable). This dataset consists of multiple features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses, which help in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases.

Dataset Features:

Mean Radius, Mean Texture, Mean Perimeter, Mean Area, etc.

Worst Texture, Worst Area, Worst Smoothness, etc.

Diagnosis (Target Variable: 0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding

Machine Learning Libraries:

numpy, pandas for data manipulation
